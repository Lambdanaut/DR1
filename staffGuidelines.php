echo(tobbs("This is a rough guide to the Rules, and appropriate 
punishments for breaking them.

Now of course, there will be grey areas, and you shouldn't 
follow this guide to a T. 
It's not like I listed every specific situation that will 
occur and what to do about it.
It's just a guide that should help you guys if you are 
confused about the rules, or aren't sure what to do.

[reddot][b]Rule 1.)[u] Art Theft[/u][/b]
The use of another artist's artwork [i]without creditting or 
having permission.[/i] This includes recoloring and tracing. 
Stealing art from DrawRawr Users and posting it on Another 
site such as Deviantart also counts as Art theft. 

[u]If you see Artwork posted on DR that you suspect does not 
belong to the poster:[/u]
[dot] Check on 
[url=http://www.tineye.com/]www.tineye.com[/url] and do some 
research. Talk with other Mods in the Mod chat.
[dot] Is it really art theft? If not, do nothing.
[dot] If it is, is it a first time offense? If so, send them a 
warning in a PM. Let them know that if they do not 
credit/delete the artwork within 24 hours, they will be 
banned. 
If they do not comply, make a voting prop for a temporary 
Submission ban.
[dot] If it is a second time offense, make a voting 
proposition. Art Theft is taken very seriously on DR. 
If someone does it a second time, it is not on accident. The 
punishment is permaban.
[dot] (Don't forget to delete the offending artwork as well. 
[b]BUT ONLY THE OFFENDING ARTWORK. NOT THE WHOLE GALLERY.[/b])

[reddot][b]Rule 2.)[u] EXPLICIT Pornography[/u][/b]
On DrawRawr, anything that is Drawn, sculpted, or otherwise 
created by the poster is allowed. Photographic artistic nudity 
is of course allowed as well. Photographic pornography is not. 
In other words, real people.

For example. 

This (NSFW) is okay: 
[url]http://www.drawrawr.com/arts/3749.php[/url]
As is this (Also NSFW): 
[url]http://almudena-stock.deviantart.com/art/Release-me-4-134192379[/url]
THIS HOWEVER (...duh nsfw): 
[url]http://gorge7mx.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2s3fkz[/url]
Is NOT art. No matter how many filters you add to it.

Non artwork images such as profile pictures and images in 
journals/comments Must abide by these same rules, except it 
doesn't have to be their own work (obviously). 
Censored images are okay as long as you cannot easily make out 
what is behind the censor.

[u]If you see a pornographic image on DR:[/u]
[dot] delete the offending artwork immediately.
[dot] PM the poster with a warning and an explanation as to 
why the art was deleted.
[dot] If this is a second time offense, make a voting 
proposition. The appropriate punishment would be a submission 
ban or permaban depending on amount. (if they are maliciously 
spamming, permaban. One or two images, submission ban)
[dot] Third time offense? Voting prop for permaban.

As for mature art, it is allowed. But it must be marked 
Mature!
[u]If you see an artwork that is mature, but not correctly 
marked:[/u]

[dot] Edit the artwork and Mark it Mature for the user.
[dot] PM the user with a mild warning. Just nicely remind them 
to mature their artwork.
[dot] Usually we'd just warn them and mature it. EVEN for a 
second or third time offense. 
But if they continually post several unmarked mature pics a 
day and won't comply (or they continually UNmark their art 
after you've matured it), a temporary submission ban might be 
neccissary.

[u]If someone leaves a comment with a mature image:[/u]
[dot] Delete the comment.
[dot] PM the poster with a warning.
[dot] If it's spammed all over the site or something malicious 
like that, permaban.
[dot] If it's a second or third time offense, a three day-two 
week commenting ban would be appropriate. 

[reddot][b]Rule 3.)[u] Hacking[/u][/b]
Hacking the site OR someone's profile. In other words, access 
without permission.
[dot] If it's the site, immediate permaban.
[dot] If it's a profile, voting prop for temporary ban on the 
hacked profile and then LET AN ADMIN KNOW and we will handle 
it.

[reddot][b]Rule 4.)[u] Spamming[/u][/b]
Flooding the site or a user's updates with unneccesary 
repeated posts. This can harm the server and is a big 
inconvenience for users.
This includes posting the same artwork multiple times, journal 
spam, or spamming comments. 
However, a user spamming their OWN account does not count 
unless it is severe enough to possibly harm the site. 
(unlikely) 
For example, posting 10 repeated comments on their own journal 
or userpage. That's okay.

[u]If you see Artwork spam:[/u]

[dot] Delete the multiple artworks (leave one.. unless the 
artwork is also against the TOS) and give the user a warning. 
[dot] Second offense, voting prop for temporary ban. How long 
the ban lasts would probably depend on how much artwork was 
spammed.
[dot] If it's two or three images, (like perhaps an accidental 
double or triple post) then just delete all but one (try to 
leave the one with the most comments/favs/views for them) and 
let the user know in a PM that you deleted the extra ones for 
them and why.

[u]If you see comment spam:[/u]

[dot] Delete all but one (unless the comment itself is also 
against the TOS)
[dot] PM the poster and advise them not to do it anymore.
[dot] if this is a second time offense, a harsher warning or 
temporary ban depending on amount. Third time, voting prop for 
temporary ban, or perma ban depending on the amount of spam.

[u]If you see journal Spam:[/u]

[dot] Delete all but one (unless the Journal contains 
something that is also against the TOS)
[dot] PM the user and let them know why.
[dot] if this is a second time offense, a harsher warning or 
temporary ban depending on amount. Third time, voting prop for 
temporary ban, or perma ban depending on the amount of spam.
[dot] If it's two or three Journals, (like perhaps an 
accidental double or triple post) then just delete all but one 
(try to leave the one with the most comments for them) and let 
the user know in a PM that you deleted the extra ones for them 
and why.

[reddot][b]Rule 5.)[u] SEVERE Harassment[/u][/b]
Harassment that involves MULTIPLE users, and is so severe it 
is causing a noticable problem on the site or among the 
community.
Make sure the users involved are not actually friends fooling 
around with each other. 
Also, if the 'victim' is noticably uneffected by the 
harassment, then ignore it.

[u]If you see severe harassment on DR:[/u]
[dot] Watch for a while or ask questions to assure it is not 
two friends fooling around.
[dot] Warn the offending user (in some cases both or multiple 
users) to stop or they will be banned.
[dot] If they do not comply, voting prop for temporary comment 
ban.
[dot] If this has happened between these users MULTIPLE TIMES, 
or you have gotten a large number of complaints from other 
users about this person (I'm talkin' more than 20) a permaban 
MIGHT be in order.

[reddot][b]Rule 6.)[u] Ban Evasion[/u][/b]
Evading a ban. ie: Making a new account after your account has 
already been banned.

[dot] If you suspect an account is a ban evasion, LET AN ADMIN 
KNOW. We can check the IP and maybe get more clues.
[dot] If ban evasion is confirmed, permaban voting prop.


I think that about covers it. If you have ANY QUESTIONS, 
[b][u]Ask an Admin.[/b][/u]"));
